Hello! My name is Abigail Priebe. I am currently studying applied mathematics at Brigham Young University - Idaho with a minor in data science. I will be graduating with my bachelor's degree in December 2021 and am interested in pursuing a career as an actuary. I look forward to getting more involved in the data science community.
